Neon Strike is a high-octane, arcade-style 2D space shooter built with pure web technologies. Navigate through a relentless asteroid field and enemy fleet while competing for the top spot on a global leaderboard.  Designed with a sleek "Retro-Future" aesthetic, the game combines the classic twitch-gameplay of Galaga with modern backend integration.
